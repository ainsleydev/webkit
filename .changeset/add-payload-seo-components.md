Add PayloadSEO and PayloadFooter components for rendering head meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Card, canonical URL, JSON-LD structured data) and footer code injection from Payload CMS settings. Extract `serializeSchema` as a generic utility under `utils/seo`. Add `resolveItems` helper for resolving Payload relationship fields.
