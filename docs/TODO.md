# TODO

I want you to help me configure and fix /docs.

- Configure GitHub secrets in your-first-project is simply not correct, organisation secrets get
  appended via GitHub actions, everything with TF_ is generated by terraform. Do some more research.
- Mermaid diagrams aren't being rendered, I just see the text, not the diagram.
- We should use the favicon located in /Users/Ainsley/Desktop/ainsley.dev/Website/static/favicon,
  for the links, inspect ainsley.dev
- I want to be able to run dev command (run docs server) from the root repo, come up with some
  options.
