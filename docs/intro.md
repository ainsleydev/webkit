## Introduction

WebKit is a Go-based CLI tool designed to streamline the lifecycle of web projects. It centralises configuration in a
single manifest file (`app.json`) and generates all surrounding infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and environment
scaffolding automatically.

The objective is to reduce repetitive setup work when creating new projects, improve consistency across deployments, and
provide a reliable foundation for infrastructure management.

WebKit is opinionated about conventions but extensible enough to support evolving use cases.
