# Notes & Questions

## Questions

- For environment variables, how will they be injected into each component? We have SOPS files, but how would a
  component under `cms` load this for example? Each component always usually has a `.env` file.
- Do we want to define a repo link? Why would we need it? We can reference `github.com/ainsleydev/{project_name}`
