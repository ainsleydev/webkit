# TODO

- The `config` part of the infrastructure block should be json encoded (all of it).
- Figure out a clever way to use Terratest, when should we be used this, E2E or integration?
- Start generating the Terraform plan CICD workflow.
- Husky hooks for lint staged, left hook etc.

## Nice Ideas

- Need some sort of logic for managing PR comments, updating, deleting etc.
- Dockerfile templates for each app? But can be overriden, they're usually a pain.
- GoLang CI lint file (in code style) if there's an app with Go.
- Readme generation
- Add business info to webkit? For badges and stuff on the repo (later)
