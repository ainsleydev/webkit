This prevents\nissues where applications rely on NODE_ENV to determine which database\nadapter or configuration to use.\n\nThis acts as a safety net even when NODE_ENV is defined in app.json,\nensuring it''s always present in the generated env file.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
