# Agent Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working on the WebKit codebase.

## Note For Humans

This is a living document that will improve as more people/agents use it over time. Every effort has
been made to keep the guidance in here as generic and reusable as possible. Please keep this in mind
with any future edits.

**Note**: Investigation summaries and debugging analysis should be displayed via UI only, not
committed to the repository.

## Updating Documentation

If you need to update developer guidelines, clone and edit the [ainsley.dev/website](https://github.com/ainsleydev/website) repository.
These guidelines are automatically synced from there.

## WebKit

WebKit is a Go-based CLI tool designed to streamline the lifecycle of web projects. It centralises
configuration in a single manifest file (`app.json`) and automatically generates surrounding
infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and environment scaffolding.

WebKit helps reduce repetitive setup work, improves consistency across deployments, and provides a
reliable foundation for infrastructure management.

**Key features**:

- Single source of truth via `app.json` manifest.
- Automatic generation of Docker configurations, GitHub workflows, and environment files.
- Infrastructure provisioning through Terraform.
- Secret management via SOPS.
- Template-based file generation with tracking.

## Build & Commands

Essential pnpm scripts for development are listed below.

- **Run CLI**: `pnpm webkit <command>`
- **Build**: `pnpm build`
- **Check all**: `pnpm check`
- **Format**: `pnpm format`
- **Format Go**: `pnpm format:go`
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint`
- **Lint Go**: `pnpm lint:go`
- **Test**: `pnpm test`

## Content

### Language and style

Write all content in British English. Use British spellings and punctuation throughout the codebase:

- "colour" not "color"
- "organised" not "organized"
- "centre" not "center"

### Heading style

Headings should use sentence case (only the first word capitalised):

- Correct: "Setting up webhooks"
- Incorrect: "Setting Up Webhooks"
- Incorrect: "Setting up Webhooks"

## Markdown

- Use `-` for lists, not `*`.
- End list points with a full stop.
## HTML

### Indentation

Use tabs instead of spaces for markup. Do not mix tabs with spaces, ensure it is properly formatted.

## SCSS

### Naming

Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) notation for CSS class names.

## Go

### Formatting

Use `gofmt` for standard Go formatting.

### Error handling

Always check and handle errors appropriately.

## JS

### Style

Use `camelCase` for all field names and variables.
## Git

### Commit Messages

Follow a conventional commit format with a type prefix and present tense gerund (doing words):

#### Format

```
<type>: <description>
```

#### Types

- `feat:` - Adding new features or functionality.
- `fix:` - Fixing bugs or issues.
- `chore:` - Updating dependencies, linting, or other maintenance tasks.
- `style:` - Refactoring code or improving code style (no functional changes).
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests.
- `docs:` - Updating documentation.

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before submitting changes, agents should verify the following:

- [ ] All tests pass locally.
- [ ] Code is properly formatted.
- [ ] New exported types, functions, and constants have documentation comments.
