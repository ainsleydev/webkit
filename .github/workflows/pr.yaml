            **Scoring guide** (1-10):
            - 9-10: Production ready, excellent quality
            - 7-8: Minor improvements needed, safe to merge
            - 5-6: Notable issues but functional
            - 3-4: Significant problems requiring fixes
            - 1-2: Critical issues, do not merge

            **Review focus**:
            - Follow AGENTS.md conventions (British English, sentence case headings, no unnecessary emojis outside severity indicators)
            - Code quality and adherence to project style
            - Potential bugs or logic errors
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage (Go: parallel tests, table-driven; JS: vitest patterns)
            - Performance considerations

            **Guidelines**:
            - Only report actionable issues
            - Skip trivial issues that linters catch
            - For large PRs (>500 lines), focus on critical/high-impact issues only
            - Use `<details>` sections for lengthy explanations
            - Keep feedback concise and professional
