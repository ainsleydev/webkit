# Ideas

-   Validate HTML5 input once rendered - See: https://codeberg.org/derat/validate
-   Validate Schema.org types using go get github.com/xeipuuv/gojsonschema - See: "https://schema.org/docs/jsonldcontext.json"
-   To Schema, navigation items, rename to Html package insteal of markip
-   The adapter has methods that returns html elements or structures, payload and static can implement them.
-   Have a internal/website/definition file for the service json
-   How about web as a package name?
